# Job Assembly (frontend)

- <b>Job Assembly</b>: An app portal to track jobs you've applied to, view various information and details associated with that job (i.e. location, requirements, salary, etc.) and update a to-do list associated with each application (i.e. checking off items on a list that include: had phone screen, met with recruiter, etc.).

- <b>What it looks like</b>:

- <b>Bugs</b>: 
    - When you create an account and go to the homepage, you are taken to a white blank page before you're taken to the main page.

- <b>Planned future enhancements</b>: 
    - The ability to have a separate log in for a recruiter (as opposed to just a log in for a job-seeker), in order for them to see which jobs applicants are interested in and where they are in the application process. 
    - The ability for the job-seeker to apply to jobs within the app.
